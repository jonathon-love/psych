description: >-
  A general purpose toolbox for personality, psychometric theory and
  experimental psychology. Functions are primarily for multivariate analysis and
  scale construction using factor analysis, principal component analysis,
  cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others provide basic
  descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is done using factor analysis of
  tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing data at
  multiple levels include within and between group statistics, including
  correlations and factor analysis. Functions for simulating and testing
  particular item and test structures are included. Several functions serve as a
  useful front end for structural equation modeling. Graphical displays of path
  diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using
  basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on
  psychometric theory as well as publications in personality research. For more
